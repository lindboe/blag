![Lizzi](/me.jpeg)

I'm a software developer based out of Portland, OR. I've mostly worked in back-end web development, but I'm always looking for new learning opportunities.

What I excel at:

- Back-end web development, with a focus on security.
- Functional programming.
- Developing a team's ability to communicate and collaborate.
- Supporting the people I work with.

**Social Media**

**Want to work with me? This is what I look for:**

- **An empathetic, highly collaborative team.** The best teams raise each other up, so that everyone does better work than they could alone.
- **A chance for me to develop new skills at work.** For example, I'd love to join a team that is happy with me learning a new language they use on the job.
- **A culture that cares about the ethics of what they're building.**
